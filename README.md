# http-predict

HTTP satellite tracking and prediction service written in Node.js.

Existing software solutions needs compilation, and are typically restricted to one programming language. 
By exposing the functionality as an HTTP service, you can now obtain real-time satellite tracking information from 
nearly all programming languages with HTTP support.

# Deployment

You know Node.js, right?

Oh, check the demo at <https://bbs.kechuang.org/static/tracker/>
